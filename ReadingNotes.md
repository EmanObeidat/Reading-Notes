## 1. Data Structures and Algorithms
```
(1) Recursion: it is a function that calls it self,it makes solution clearer and easier to understand. it summarize the code in a few lines and it breaks down the problem into two cases , base case and recursive case.
```
```
    -Base case: when function stop calling it self. it determine when the function should stop calling it self.
```
```
    -Recursive case: when function calls it self.
```

```(2) **Data Structure :** Data structures are specialized methods for arranging and storing data in computers so that actions on the stored data can be carried out more quickly. The use of data structures is widespread and varied in the domains of computer science and software engineering.
      
1.Compound data: data items that grouped togethor.

2.Big O notation: it is the way we measure how good a data  structure is doing a specifiec thing like adding new items, storing and searching.
```

 **There are multiple types of data structure:**
 ```
 1-Node: The atomic unit of linked list which contains value and pointer. 
 "Pointer":cinnect you to the next node in chain.

 2-Array: it is a continous block of cells in computer memory.

 3-Hash Table: it is an object which works as array but its memory locations dosn't have to be next to each other.it has a "Collision" problem which means that two keys could hash to the same memory location.

 4-Stack: it looks like an array but with a few additional features. we can add to the top of it by using push() and we can remove from the top of it by using pob().

5-Queue: it looks like an array but with a few additional features. we can add to the end of it by using .enqueue() and we can remove from the it of it by using .dequeue().
7.Graphs : Similar to linked list where you have nodes that pointing to each other and the pointer in it called edge.

6-Trees: Special kind of hierarchical graph in which data expands out in one direction . we can use it to represent a lot of things.
The first node in tree called "Root" which should has two nodes , left node must be lower than root and right node must be higher than root. 
```
## Discussion Questions: ##
     Answer 1:We must consider the operations we will do and the frequency of their execution while choosing the optimum data structure to address a certain challenge.
     Answer 2: By using functions like if statement to determine when to function should stop calling it self


  ## 2.Engineering Readings  
  
   **what steps to take to be a better problem-solver?**
   ```
   1. Understand what is the problem exactly
   2. Plan: put a good plan to solve the problem
   3. Divide the problem into subproblems, this will make the problem easier to solve 
   ```
   if you facing a stuck, you have to keep calm and don't worry, you can go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong, also you can take a look for the code and think about another approach. if any of the previous solution dosn't work, delete all code and retype it.
   "you have to practise as mush possible as "

    Answers of quastion:

  1. my individual strengths, achievements, and experiences.also, my ability to communicate complex ideas in a simple way.

  2.It can be beneficial to take a break from my work and step away for a while when i feel stuck on a challenging section of code or reasoning. This can assist in clearing my thoughts and enabling me to return to the issue from a different angle. Also,It can be beneficial to divide a big problem into smaller, more manageable portions. Start by determining the main elements of the issue, and then address each element separately. This strategy can lessen your sense of overload and speed up the process of finding a solution.in addition, work with a team help us to be more creative.
