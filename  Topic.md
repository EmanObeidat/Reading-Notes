## 1.Classes and Objects
 The difference between classes and objects:
 
 In general: class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class.
 ```
 1.Objects are particular instances of a class that each have their unique values for the characteristics that define them, whereas classes specify the properties and behaviors that are shared by a group of objects.
 ```
 ```
 2.Classes can be associated with methods, variables, and other properties and are specified with the term "class". While Objects are created by calling the class as a function with the "()" operator.
 ```
 ```
 3.Classes can be thought of as user-defined data types, while objects are variables of those data types.
 ```
 ```
 4.Multiple objects can be created from the same class, each with its own set of values for the class attributes.
 ```
 **To create and manage instances of a class:**
 ```
 step (1):Define a class with the "class" keyword and give it a name. Inside the class, define any attributes or methods that are relevant to the class.
```
 here is an example: 

 class Person:

    def __init__(self, name, age): 
    
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```
step (2):Create an object of the class by calling the class as a function with the "()" operator. Assign the resulting object to a variable.
```
like this:
  def greet(self):

    print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")
```
step(3):
Call the methods of the object using dot notation. For example, if the class has a method called "greet()", you can call it using the syntax "object_name.greet()".
```
## Recursion
```
Recursion is a programming method where a function repeatedly calls itself to solve an issue. Problems that can be broken down into progressively smaller subproblems until they are straightforward enough to be solved directly can be solved via recursion. it requires careful consideration and understanding of the underlying concepts to avoid errors and inefficiencies.
```
example:
```
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```
**It's important to follow some best practices when using recursion method like the following:**
```
1.Define a base case
2.Reduce the problem size.

3.Ensure progress:Each recursive call should make progress towards the base case

4.Use recursion only when necessary because it can cause a stack overflow error if the recursion depth is too high. 

5.Avoid side effects: A recursive function should not modify any variables outside of its scope, as this can lead to unexpected behavior.

```
## pytest fixtures 
**Pytest fixtures** are a mechanism in the Pytest testing framework that provide a way to share data and resources among test functions. A fixture is essentially a function that provides a fixed set of data or resources that can be used by multiple test functions.

**Code coverage** is a measurement of how much of the code is executed during testing. It is a way to measure the quality of the testing and identify areas of the code that are not covered by tests.
```
 how they can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project?
```
To use Pytest fixtures and code coverage together, you can define fixtures that provide the necessary data and resources for testing, and then use those fixtures in your test functions. You can also use a code coverage tool such as coverage.py to measure the code coverage of your tests and identify areas of the code that need more testing.
