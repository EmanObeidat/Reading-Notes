# Permissions & Postgresql
### Q1: What are the key components and purpose of Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions, and how do they help in securing an API?

Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions are a set of built-in tools and classes provided by Django Rest Framework to control access and enforce security on API endpoints. These permissions allow you to define who can perform certain actions on specific resources within your API. By utilizing DRF permissions, you can enforce authentication and authorization rules to ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access certain API endpoints.

```
There are four main key components of DRF permissions:

IsAuthenticated: This permission class ensures that the user making the request is authenticated. In other words, it requires the user to be logged in to access the API endpoint. If the user is not authenticated, the API will return a 401 Unauthorized response.

IsAdminUser: This permission class restricts access to users with admin privileges. It allows only users with the is_staff flag set to True to access the API. Other authenticated users without admin privileges will be denied access.

IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly: This permission class allows read access to any user, whether authenticated or not. However, only authenticated users can perform write, update, or delete operations. This is useful for public APIs where you want to allow read access to everyone but restrict write access to authenticated users.

Custom Permissions: DRF also provides the flexibility to create custom permission classes that fit the specific security requirements of your API. You can define your own rules based on user roles, group memberships, or any other criteria.

How DRF Permissions Help in Securing an API:

Authentication: DRF permissions, especially the IsAuthenticated class, ensure that only authenticated users can access sensitive parts of your API. This helps protect your API from unauthorized access and ensures that only registered users can use certain features or access certain resources.

Authorization: DRF permissions handle authorization by checking user roles or privileges, such as IsAdminUser, to control access to certain API endpoints. This ensures that only users with specific permissions can perform certain actions, protecting sensitive operations from unauthorized users.

Read vs. Write Access: The IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly class helps segregate read and write access. Publicly available data can be accessed by anyone (read access), while only authenticated users can perform modifications (write access). This reduces the risk of accidental data modifications or deletions from unauthenticated users.

Custom Permissions: With custom permissions, you have full control over access rules. You can implement fine-grained access control based on specific requirements, roles, or business logic. This allows you to tailor the security of your API to match your application's unique needs.

### Q2:In SQL, what is the purpose of the SELECT statement, and how would you use it to retrieve all columns from a table called ‘employees’?

```
In SQL, the SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database. It is one of the fundamental statements in SQL and allows you to query data from one or more tables based on specified conditions. The SELECT statement is highly versatile and can be used to perform various operations, such as retrieving specific columns, filtering rows, sorting data, and performing calculations.

To retrieve all columns from a table called 'employees,' you can use the SELECT statement with the wildcard symbol (*). The wildcard symbol represents all columns in the table, and using it simplifies the query by avoiding the need to list each column explicitly.
```

### Q3: Can you explain the role of DRF Generic Views and provide examples of their usage in building a RESTful API?
```
Django Rest Framework (DRF) provides a powerful feature called Generic Views, which are pre-built views that handle common patterns in building RESTful APIs. These views abstract away much of the repetitive code and simplify the process of creating API endpoints for CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations. Generic Views help developers create API views quickly and follow best practices for building RESTful APIs.

The main role of DRF Generic Views is to reduce the amount of boilerplate code required to implement common API operations and to promote code reusability. Instead of writing separate views for each CRUD operation, you can use Generic Views to handle these operations based on the model and queryset you provide.


 the API will have the following endpoints:

GET /tasks/: Retrieves a list of all tasks.
POST /tasks/: Creates a new task.
GET /tasks/<id>/: Retrieves a specific task by ID.
PUT /tasks/<id>/ or PATCH /tasks/<id>/: Updates a specific task by ID.
DELETE /tasks/<id>/: Deletes a specific task by ID.

```
