## Beginners Guide to Big O
```
1.Time complexity : refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to solve a problem as the input size grows larger .It is typically expressed using big O notation, which gives an upper bound on the number of operations the algorithm will perform as a function of the input size.

2.Space complexity : refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to solve a problem as the input size grows larger. It is also expressed using big O notation, and represents the maximum amount of memory space the algorithm will need to store data as a function of the input size
