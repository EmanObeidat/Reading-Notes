## Explain the concept of dynamic routes in Next.js and how they differ from static routes.
```
Dynamic Routes vs. Static Routes in Next.js:

In Next.js, dynamic routes and static routes are two different approaches to building pages within your application.

Static Routes:
Static routes are pages that are pre-rendered at build time and do not change based on user input or data. These pages are generated during the build process and served as HTML files. Static routes are great for content that doesn't change frequently and can be cached for faster loading times.

Dynamic Routes:
Dynamic routes allow you to create pages that depend on parameters or data. These pages are generated on-the-fly as users access them. For example, you might have a blog website where each blog post has a unique URL based on its ID or slug. With dynamic routes, you can create a single template and generate multiple pages using the same code structure but different data.

## Describe the process of deploying a Next.js application. What are the key steps involved, and what are some deployment platforms you can use?
```
Deploying a Next.js Application:

Deploying a Next.js application typically involves the following steps:

Build the Application:
Use the command npm run build or yarn build to generate the production-ready build of your Next.js application. This compiles your source code and generates optimized assets.

Choose a Deployment Platform:
There are several deployment platforms you can use to host your Next.js application, including:

Vercel: A platform designed specifically for Next.js applications. It offers seamless deployment and hosting.
Netlify: A popular platform for static site hosting that also works well with Next.js.
Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud Platform: These cloud providers offer options for deploying Next.js applications as well.
Configure Deployment Settings:
Different platforms may require different configuration steps. Generally, you'll need to specify the build command (e.g., npm run build), the folder containing the build output, and other settings.

Deploy the Application:
Once your configuration is set up, trigger the deployment process. The platform will upload your build files, set up routing, and make your application accessible online.

Domain Setup (Optional):
You can associate a custom domain with your deployed application for a more professional look. This involves configuring DNS settings to point to your deployment platform.

## How does Next.js handle static file serving? Discuss the default folder structure for storing static assets and explain how to reference them in a Next.js application.
```
Next.js provides a way to serve static files, such as images, CSS files, and fonts. By default, any files placed in the public directory of your project are automatically served as static assets.

using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for static assets can further improve performance by distributing them across different servers around the world for faster loading times.
