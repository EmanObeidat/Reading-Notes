## What is React Context, and how does it help in managing state and data sharing in a React application?
React Context is a feature in React that provides a way to share data across components without having to pass the data explicitly through each level of the component tree. It's designed to manage global state or data that many components in an application need to access. Context can be thought of as a centralized data store that eliminates the need to "prop drill" data down from parent to child components.
```
React Context solves the problem of prop drilling by allowing you to define a "context" and then provide it to the component tree. This context can hold any data you want to share across components, such as user authentication status, theme preferences, or any other global state

## Explain the useContext Hook and how it can be used to access data from a React Context within a functional component.
```
useContext Hook:

The useContext hook is a React hook that provides a way to consume the data stored in a React Context within a functional component. It allows you to access the context values without needing to wrap your component in a higher-order component or use a render prop pattern.

## Describe the purpose of Next.js, and provide an example from the Vercel Next.js Examples reading on how it can be used to build a scalable web application.
```
Next.js:

Next.js is a popular React framework that enhances the development experience for building server-rendered React applications. It provides several features such as automatic code splitting, server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing out of the box.


One of the Vercel Next.js Examples demonstrates how to build a scalable web application with Next.js. The "with-iron-session" example showcases how to implement server-side authentication using a library called "iron-session."

In this example, Next.js is used to create a simple authentication system where users can sign up, log in, and view their profile page. Iron-session is used to handle server-side session management and cookie encryption, providing a secure way to manage user authentication.

By using Next.js's server-side rendering capabilities, the example demonstrates how to build a scalable and secure authentication system while benefiting from features like server-side rendering for improved SEO and performance. This showcases Next.js's ability to handle complex scenarios and build production-ready applications.
