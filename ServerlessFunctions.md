## Q1:What are the key characteristics of serverless computing, and how does it differ from traditional server-based architectures?
```
Serverless computing is a cloud computing model that allows developers to build and run applications without the need to manage or provision servers explicitly

1.No server management
2.Event-driven architecture
3.Automatic scaling
4.Granular billing
5.Stateless functions
6.High availability and fault tolerance
7.Rapid development and deployment

In contrast, traditional server-based architectures involve manually managing servers, provisioning resources, and configuring scaling rules. Developers need to consider infrastructure management, server maintenance, and capacity planning. Scaling can be a complex task, requiring the addition or removal of servers to handle varying workloads. Traditional architectures often involve upfront costs and are not as granularly billed as serverless computing.

## Q2:How can one get started with Vercel, and what are the main steps involved in deploying a serverless function using Vercel?
```
To get started with Vercel and deploy a serverless function, you can follow these main steps:

1.Sign up for a Vercel account
2.Install the Vercel CLI (Command Line Interface): 
   "npm install -g vercel"
3.Initialize a new project: vercel init
4.Configure serverless function
5.Deploy the project: To deploy your project to Vercel, run the following command: vercel
6.Test the serverless function: Once the deployment is complete, you can test your serverless function by accessing the corresponding endpoint
7.Custom domain (optional): If you have a custom domain, you can configure it in Vercel to map it to your deployed project. This involves adding DNS records or configuring DNS settings with your domain registrar. Vercel provides documentation on how to set up custom domains.

## Q3:What are APIs, and how can they be utilized in Python applications to access and manipulate data from external sources?
```
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. They provide a structured way for developers to access and manipulate data or functionality from external sources, such as web services, databases, or other software systems.

In Python, APIs can be utilized to access and manipulate data from external sources by making HTTP requests and handling the responses
```
## Q4:What is the Requests library in Python, and how can it be used to interact with APIs by sending HTTP requests? Can you provide an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library?
```
The Requests library in Python is a popular third-party library that simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests and handling responses. It provides an easy-to-use interface to interact with APIs and other web services.


The Requests library in Python is a popular third-party library that simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests and handling responses. It provides an easy-to-use interface to interact with APIs and other web services.

To use the Requests library, you need to install it first. You can do this using a package manager like pip:
"pip install requests"
Once installed, you can import the library in your Python script and start making HTTP requests.
