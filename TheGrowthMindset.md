Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset:
```
- The idea that we can grow our brain's capacity to learn and to solve problems. 
- when we faced a problem, we will have two ways of thinking about it,the first one => can i solve it or Am i have enough smart to solve it ? and the second one => i can't solve it yet!
we have to work on develop our minds and we should believe that we can imrove our self and do it.
```
Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit:
```
-  We have to know that IQ wasn't the only thing separating the successful student, you may don't get high level in it but thats dosn't mean that you are failer! we have to grit more and try for more times to be successful person and thats need type of talent.
- we have to believe that the ability to learn is not fixed, it can be changed.
```
